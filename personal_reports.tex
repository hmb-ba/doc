\subsection*{Task}
The given task combines two topics I am very interested in: Data integration
with messaging and the functional programming language Haskell. Messaging is
something I get in touch from time to time during my studies but only
theoretically. My intent for the bachelor thesis was really to get in touch with
the concepts and underlying technologies in detail. To combine this by learning
a new progamming paradigm was additional motivation to choose this challenging
topic for my thesis.

\subsection*{Teamwork}
The thesis was predestined for working in a team of two.
